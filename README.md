# My Portfolio Website 
Finding a job and securing an interview with a good resume will always be an important part of a programmers journey. Without a doubt, a personal portfolio website is one way to demonstrate one's programming ability, as well as to showcase oneself. So here's my personal portfolio website: https://windjammer6.github.io/portfolio/

This Github repository is hosting the codes for my personal portfolio website. Code template taken from [Shelley Benhoff's Github's personal portfolio website template source code](https://github.com/sbenhoff007/portfolio) (credits to her :)) and is further built upon for my personal use. This Github repository hosting the codes for my personal portfolio website is deployed with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), you can see how this is done from this Youtube video by HoffsTech (link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CykufIPK_6o&t=193s).

## Troubleshooting Issues Regarding Deployment with Github Pages
Edits to the code might not be reflected on the portfolio website page by regular refreshing of the portfolio website page on your local browser. You may need to wait until the re-building of the code is done before doing a hard refreshing with the following commands:
```text
Windows/Linux: CTRL + SHIFT + R
Mac: CMD + SHIFT + R
Open in incognito mode to bypass cache.
```
